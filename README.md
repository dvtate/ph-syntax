# Postfix Haskell Code extension
This extension provides basic syntax highlighting for [Postfix Haskell](https://github.com/dvtate/postfix-haskell).

# Development
Use Code's debug tab as well as `npm install && npm run build` when ready to install via right click from file explorer tab.

# Note
It's recommended to use Code OSS and not Microsoft's proprietary version which presumably has added bloat, drm and spyware.
